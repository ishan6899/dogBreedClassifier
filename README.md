# Dog Breed Classifier

## Description

This project takes an image as an input .If it is a dog image it detects it's breed .If its a human image it detects the closest resembling breed.
It is based on state of the art CNN.I used two models.One that I made from scratch(Accuracy=33%)and one that uses transfer learning(accuracy=84%)
Along with that I have uploaded the additional images that have been used by me.

## Usage

Just download the datasets required in your local machine.Change the relevant path of the dataset in the notebook.Along with that change the path of image that you would like to upload.
After that run all the cells.You should be good to go.

## Dependencies

- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Other neccesary libraries

## Additional Information

Try to use a GPU to speed up the training.
